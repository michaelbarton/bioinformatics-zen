title: Bioinformatics software is a disgrace to our field.

Every piece of software written for publication, which then can't be found
after publication is grant funding thrown away. Every piece of software that
only worked for the author during manuscript preparation is grant money thrown
away. Every piece of software reinvented solely for the purpose of adding a new
feature and publishing is grant money thrown away.

Grants are harder and harder to obtain, yet we fund the current attrition of
moving bioinformatics software forward one reinvention at a time. Where else is
it acceptable to reinvent a tool rather than try to improve upon an existing
one? Count how many types of webservers are commonly used across the web, then
count how many different genome assemblers have been published. If we were a
company and we behaved this way, we would have gone out of business long ago.
We have accepted a state whereby the short-term reward of publication trumps
the longer-term goal of maintaining and improving existing open-source
software. We now reap the rewards of this every time we can't find stable
software to run our analyses.
