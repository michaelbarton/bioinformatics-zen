title: "Fear and self-loathing: getting old in tech"
---

## Outline Notes

- Read aloud
- Cynicism is poison for the soul
- Is the fear about age real or does it mean I have more experience and can do
  more.
- Try to get end paragraphs to snap, especially into the next ones.
- Pointing at a chunk of money in my bank account is an easy thing to point to
  and say, I must have done well. But money is a poor filler for the hole
  that's inside me. For the voice of my 20 year old self looking up from
  promise of a future technology career and asking: is this it?
- Mention the struggle I had with getting out of bed during COVID. Just looking
  at my phone each morning.
- Picture illustration of cambiozola cheese
- Satirical under 40s LICENCE
- Put quote in a fake github repo pull request comment.
- HTML tags <hopeful>

When I was young and starting my career, I was hungry to learn. I would spend
ten hours a day reading, note-taking, and playing with code. Introducing myself
to a world where DNA could be manipulated with computers was exhilarating.
Until then, I had worked in odd jobs doing butchery or running a checkout at
Sainsbury's. After manual jobs, learning about bioinformatics and programming
was like finding a new room in a house after living in it for 25 years. I was
so energised that I'd read the O'Reilly Java book cover to cover. I'd sit there
each evening in my tiny Newcastle rental, on my secondhand IKEA desk, and make
notes about new concepts: magic words like hash tables, linked lists, classes,
abstract classes, abstract factories, abstract factory factories, abstract
factory impls, and other exciting java concepts.

Caption: The O'Reilly Java book; like many Java programmers, I can only assume
from the tiger's expression that it has "seen some shit".

As I'm getting older, I often reflect on how I've changed compared to that
person. An optimistic younger me who now feels distant, like seeing your
reflection in an old, cloudy mirror. Someone who feels like I'd have little to
talk about if I met them now. That younger optimism came from excitement to be
part of the tech industry, back when Google's motto was "Don't be evil." and
people still believed it. When Gmail was revolutionary, and all your favourite
blogs were in Google Reader.

Compared to that younger person, screentime makes me tired physically in a way
it didn't before. I can no longer drink four cups of coffee and execute 8-,
10-, or 12-hour coding sessions. More urgently, my earlier hunger to improve
myself has faded. My desire to consume coding books has morphed into a hunger
to consume Trader Joe's Cambozola cheese on crackers. The excitement for new
programming books has gone. I can't remember the last time I spent more than
five minutes in the programming section at Barnes and Noble. I will still
occasionally listen to tech books on Audible. That way I can instead be a
passive participant in learning about new technology.

There's an irony that the tech industry is located in San Francisco. Once a
counterculture city set opposite to hoarding capital and authority. Now the
capital of an industry that spends billions of dollars to maintain your
attention. Where your value can be reliably measured to the hundredth of a cent
as the likelihood you will click on a video ad. Where an Uber drops you off at
a bar after work, so you can skip the human-shit dotted streets. But that the
same driver has to get by without employer health insurance or sick leave. I
saw the greatest minds of my generation paid six figures to create the apps
that enslave their own attention. The beat generation is replaced with the
beat-down generation.

Author note: the last sentence is too melodramatic?

It seems like a lifetime, or at least a Main Era—the kind of peak that never
comes again. San Francisco in the middle sixties was a very special time and
place to be a part of. Maybe it meant something. Maybe not, in the long run…
but no explanation, no mix of words or music or memories can touch that sense
of knowing that you were there and alive in that corner of time and the world.
Whatever it meant...

I had that feeling living in the Bay Area, for a few years at least. A feeling
that being part of "tech" was worthwhile. That averaged over all startups we
were making the world better. That more access to information would improve our
lives. That freer and broader discussion would let us show each other how we
are being disenfranchised. That it would make us less lonely and isolated. That
technology could solve our problems and set us free. Free from the bullshit of
menial work, dead-end work, and dead inside managers. That it'd give us a
reason to get out of bed each morning. Now instead, when I wake up I just reach
for my phone to see what's changed on Reddit. Usually not much in the 6 hours
since I fell asleep scrolling it.

The US government is investigating whether Facebook knew its software harmed
children, weakened democracy, and provoked violence in developing countries. For
a while, Tesla made more money trading Bitcoin than selling electric cards.
There's a feeling of cynicism now. No one is surprised by another Forbes
headline from the Theranos, Nikola, WeWork venture capital-funded conveyor
belt. Most of us don't give a second thought to making the world better. All we
care about is when is the best time to jump to the next startup to get in early
on the options. Which of the five companies actively recruiting us is likely to
have the highest payout.

We're more likely to lose sleep because a coworker makes $375k a year while we
only make $362k. Not because our employer helped Russia influence a national
election. Or because our employer used tips to pay the salary of delivery
drivers. Or because our employer lobbied to pass a law denying its own drivers
sick leave and health insurance.

What would continuing to improve myself even mean in this environment? Would
getting better at my job lead to anything meaningful? Or does it just end up
making some founders a little bit richer? But if I'm actively improving myself,
then am I just coasting along? Giving in to career entropy?

This quote starts a self-loathing that has me gnawing on my fingernails.
Staring blankly at the globs of dried peanut butter tucked amongst the tiny
highways of my work keyboard. Is the peanut butter stuck in the trough between
two cherry MX mechanical switch keys a metaphor for where my career has gotten
after fifteen years?

Would tech companies be happy if employees did nothing to manage their own
performance? Unlikely. Do they expect their employees to train at the intensity
of an Olympic athlete but for software engineering? Probably not. In between
these two extremes are most software engineers constantly improving themselves
in return for their astronomical salaries? The recurrent theme on sites like
Hacker News and Blind is that if I want a job at Google or Netflix, I should be
constantly be grinding out coding practice exercises every day. Being able to
churn out the solution to inverting a red-black tree is the bare minimum any
software engineer should be able to do. At least that's what many hiring
processes have institutionalised.

I'm reasonably confident that my employer is happy with my performance. Most
employers understand that getting a bunch of zeros and ones in the correct
order from a 200lb fleshy bag of water, half-digested food, and coffee is a
tricky process at the best of times, even more so during a pandemic. My
assumption is that tech companies prefer their engineers to keep up with
technology trends. But nothing on par with a gymnast getting up at 6am before
work to engage in deliberate practice for 3 hours. So as I get older, where
does this ever-present background fear about coasting along come from?

Part of this fear is avoiding becoming stagnant: I turn up to work each day
knowing only enough to get the job done. Then in two or five years, I realise
that technology has passed me by. I'll admit I'm now useless, and everyone will
soon find out too.

I want to continue to grow and get better. There's a meaning in being good at
what you do. Software engineers often talk about craftsmanship, beyond being
paid to do a job, but doing it well for its own sake. If I'm spending 40+ hours
a week doing something, this time investment demands mindful intention. The
reward is pointing at a finished project and knowing I could do it because I
was competent.

Beyond the fear of obsolescence, all of us only really have a limited amount of
"good years" in/ our careers. San Harris puts this well "The reality is that
don't know much time you have. Do that most important thing now. Expression
your love now. Relinquish those hangups now. [...] Live fully now, for one day
you will die." Each of us only has one life. There is no dress rehearsal. I
want to find a meaning in this life that is the antidote to just waking up and
immediately browsing social media.

At some point, the good years in my life will end. COVID has shown that, for
many of us, this could happen much sooner than we would like. I might be asking
myself if I lived a good life when I'm 77. But I may also have an unexpected
reason to be asking myself this when I'm 50, next year, or possibly even next
week. It's the most urgent question to ask myself, what would I do with my time
if I knew I only had two or three good years left? Urgent because this is what
we spend most of our waking time doing, and ultimately because we just don't
have as much time as we think. Do I want to use that time earning $400k a gear
so that you'll spend an extra 30s browsing ads?

HERE <hopeful?>

For the most part I've enjoyed my career so far. I'm grateful for that. After
answering phones in a call centre or selling electricity door to door, getting
paid as much as I do to write code occasionally feels unreal. A background in
genetics means I get paid to work on unusual problems that most programmers
don't. I have the opportunity to write software that better understands
microbial genomes or creates a DNA database of pathogens. We're at a high-water
mark in cynicism around tech. The destructive effects on housing, democracy,
small businesses, and our attention are well documented. Working in
bioinformatics feels like there's still a chance to be part of a team that
writes software to create a better future. And working at an infectious disease
startup, some of the people this software helps are lying in a hospital bed
needing a better future right now. And that's a future in tech I still want to
be a part of creating.
