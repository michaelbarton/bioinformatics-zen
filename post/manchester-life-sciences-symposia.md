Every year, Manchester University Faculty of Life Sciences organises a symposia
to highlight the work that has been produced by the department. Third year PhD
students have to produce a poster, as part of the Faculty’s graduate training
program, and to encourage students to display and discuss their work. My poster
is finished, and I’ve put it here for anyone who’s interested. Zen Faulkes has
also been kind enough to [critique this poster on his better posters blog.][bp]
