title: Never lose a great idea again

Scientists have to be left brained, rational and analytical. But at the same time very right brained, inventive and holistic. We produce ideas, and often make a creative leaps to connect previous work and new concepts. Your ideas are part of you as a scientist.

If like me, you're a touch obsessed with your work, you probably think about it everywhere. Maybe you talk abut it with your partner over dinner? How about standing in the shower running things through your head? But how often have you come up with an idea that you've quickly forgotten?

For me, writing down every idea I have has been one of my most worthwhile habits. I find that writing down ideas is an activity that gets better with practice. By giving my creative side the attention it deserves, I find that I become more confident in making that important leap - good ideas come more frequently.

Have a hard copy of your ideas is also very handy when you hit a dead end, you've got plenty of material for new inspiration.

Here's three different example systems I've used for storing ideas. All have a huge following as a method for keeping organised. I've included a link to more information on each.

A little black book with a folder at the back, and a strap to keep it closed. Hard wearing and a pleasure to write in. Looks pretty cool too. It was in my moleskine that I sketched out my ideas for Bioinformatics Zen. Just don't lose it though.

A set of cards held together by a bulldog clip. This has a huge following in the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Getting_Things_Done">GTD</a> community. Once you've written an idea you can pull the card out, leave it on your desk, and process it when you've got more time. Well worth giving a try - mine cost 30p to make.

Slightly more tricky to carry a box of index cards around. More useful in the office. I've got a wall next to my desk covered with index cards, each with a single idea on. Handy when you're writing documents and need to refer to something you thought of a while ago.
