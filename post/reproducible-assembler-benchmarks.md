title: Continuous, reproducible genome assembler benchmarking

New bioinformatics software is always being produced and published. The stream
of new developments makes it difficult to keep track of the available software
for common bioinformatics tasks. An example of this is the domain of genome
assembly where there is already a large amount of existing software.

If you are researching which bioinformatics software to use, it can be
difficult to understand how effective each piece of software will be. For
example given a new genomer assembler publication, how can you know how well it
will assemble your data? A publication may include benchmarks however these may
not be applicable to all types of data, or may include authorship bias in the
way the results are presented.

Even if you know which is the best genome assembler for your data, another
question is how easy is it to install? Does the software require complex
dependencies such as language libraries or other third-party software? How easy
is to debug the software if it fails, does it give cryptic error messages? The
poor usability experience of many bioinformatics software can lead to
scientists using the software that their colleagues knows how to use, rather
than what may be the state of the art.

## A registry of assemblers

There is precedent for solving the problem of objective benchmarks for genome
assemblers. These are the Assemblathon and GAGE:

- The [Assemblathon 1][asm1] and [Assemblathon 2][asm2] aimed to evaluate the
  current state of genome assembly. Sets of genome reads were provided to the
  genomics community and teams were invited to submit their best assembly for
  each. The quality and accuracy of each of the submitted assemblies was then
  evaluated and compared with each other.

- The [Genome Assembly Gold-Standard Evaluations (GAGE)][gage] took the
  opposite approach and instead ran several genome assemblers themselves
  against four different read datasets. The output of each assembler was then
  evaluated.

I believe that these objective evaluations are critical for the bioinformatics
community. The development of performance benchmarks, not just for genome
assembly but for all common tasks, helps researchers determine which software
they should be using in their research. I believe that this can be taken a step
further to solve the problems I described above. For instance using genome
assembly again as an example:

- Create a registry listing all available genome assemblers. This registry is
  continuously updated as new assemblers become available. This then acts as
  a resource which developers can register their assembler with and then
  allows researchers to browse these available assemblers.

- Continuously benchmark the assemblers against reference data. This would
  provide an objective evaluation of each assembler's effectiveness for a
  given data set. Running these benchmarks on a regular cycle allows new
  assemblers to be evaluated and compared against existing benchmarks. This
  allows researchers to select which genome assembler performs best for a
  given type of data, e.g. a low GC content bacterial genome.

- Provide simple installation and configuration of parameters. Each developer
  provides an out-of-the-box version of their assembler that includes
  defaults parameters for most common scenarios. The assembler should be
  packaged so that installation is as simple as possible. This allows
  researchers to use an assembler without requiring difficult or manual
  compilation of software.

I created [nucleotides - a registry of genome assemblers and benchmarks][nuc]
with the end of satisfying these goals. This website provides, a currently
short, list of genome assemblers. Each of these assemblers is shown alongside
benchmarks resulting from assembly a test set of reads and then comparing back
with the reference genome. Finally each assembler is packaged within a Docker
image so that each assembler can be downloaded from
[Docker.io](http://docker.io).

## Reproducible genome assembly benchmarks using Docker

An important part of this is that all assemblers are constructed as
[Docker][docker] images. If you are unfamiliar with Docker, an image is
analogous to a list of instructions or blueprint that specifies how an
assembler should be installed and used. If a system has Docker installed, this
blueprint (called a Dockerfile) can be used to install everything required to
get an assembler running. This thereby simplifies installation for an
assembler, each assembler can also be installed with the `docker pull` command.

If assemblers are packaged up as Docker images using a common API, then running
benchmarks against a variety of reference data is much simpler. Each assembler
can be cloned from the repository and run against test data. The assembled
contigs are then compared against the reference genome for accuracy using
[quast][]. These benchmarks are the homepage of [nucleotid.es][nuc].
Eventually, by running against a variety of test datasets, this site will
provide a way to see which assembler performs best for different kinds of data.
