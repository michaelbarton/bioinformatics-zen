### About

Doing bioinformatics I only use two tools: the keyboard and the mouse. Since I
use these tools all-day, everyday I want to use them efficiently. My opinion is
that using the keyboard as much as possible while the mouse as little as
possible, is the best way to work at a computer. In a simple example, knowing
the keyboard shortcut to run a given command means that I can execute the
command quickly without breaking the flow of typing. The text editor Vim takes
this to another level and is entirely keyboard driven. There are no drop down
menus and everything is performed using the keyboard; there's no reason for my
hands to leave the keyboard. The large number of commands for Vim means there
is a fair amount of practice required before you can use it fluently. I think
this practice is a great investment though, as being able to use Vim
intuitively makes you work faster and more efficiently. The reason for this is
because Vim has a huge functionality to be taken advantage of, using just a few
quick remembered keystrokes.

### Features

As Vim is entirely text-based, without the pretty interface of modern editors,
my original opinion was of an archaic hangover from the early days of Unix. Vim
is around twenty years old, but is still a sophisticated text editor with a
large range of functions. The large range of vim's functionality means a steep
learning curve, but the extensive help documentation is an eloquent and gentle
introduction. The commands ":vimtutor" and ":help" are the places to get
started for using Vim. Vim's greatest feature is how easy it is to move, edit
and manipulate text. This can sound trivial, but reordering paragraphs in
minutes with a mouse, takes just seconds using the keyboard with Vim. This
example is applicable to any type of text file, such as Ruby or LaTeX source
code, which is what I spend most of my time editing. Another Vim feature are
the registers, which act as super-charged clipboards. Not only can text be
stored for pasting, but also sequences of commands as well. Stored commands can
then be replayed by calling the register, this eliminates performing repetitive
actions. Typing ":help usr_10" is a good place to start for learning about
using registers for commands, as well as other ways of making large changes
quickly.

### Customise

One reason not to use Vim, is that it doesn't have the code orientated features
of integrated development environments (IDE) such as [Eclipse][eclipse] and
[Netbeans][netbeans]. But it does. Vim is easy to customise which has lead to a
community of developers creating a large number of plugins. [Code
snippets][snippets], [project drawers][nerd], and [fuzzy file finding][fuzzy]
are just some examples of plugins aimed at using Vim as an IDE. Whatever
[language][latex] or [framework][rails] you use, someone will have written a
Vim plugin. This gives Vim all the functionality to rival any IDE.
