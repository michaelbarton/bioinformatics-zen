title: Writing good code

Writing good code makes life easier. If there's a common theme in
bioinformatics, it is this: you will write a script, move on to something else,
then return to the script in a few months or years time and try to remember how
it works. The clearer the code is originally written, the better to remember
how it works. Here is a quote ["All programming is maintenance programming,
because you are rarely writing original code"][maintain]. This means that most
of your time will be spent fixing and improving code, rather than writing
fresh. Writing code is personal, and discussing what makes good code is
controversial. But I'm going do it anyway and describes what I think are a few
basic principles that can help to make code easier to maintain.

### Be too descriptive

I think code should err on the side of being too descriptive, rather than being
too concise. I mean that code should be loud and expressive about its purpose.
An example is choosing variable names.

```ruby
# Concise
seq = File.read('gene.fasta')

# Descriptive
fasta_gene_sequence = File.read('gene.fasta')
```

The second example is longer, but leaves no doubt as to what the variable
contains. The same can be applied to method names. The more specific a method
name the better to remember the function and what is returned.

```ruby
# Concise
def get_seq(file)
  # ...
end

# Descriptive
def read_fasta_from(file)
  # ...
end
```

Next are magic numbers, numbers that appear in code, but have no explanation to
their meaning. These can particularly annoying if you can't remember why you
used the number and there is no other reference to it.

```ruby
# Three, its the magic number
dna_sequence.scan(3)

# Descriptive
nucleotides_per_codon = 3
dna_sequence.scan(nucleotides_per_codon)
```

Comments never hurt either, as long as they are correct. Incorrect comments are
generally not considered useful. Comments are especially useful when the
meaning of the code is not obvious, but going too much commenting can sometimes
make code less easy to read

```ruby
# Why the chop?
protein = dna_sequence.translate.chop

# Some of wikipedia in here...
# In the genetic code, a stop codon (or termination
# codon) is a nucleotide triplet within messenger RNA
# that signals a termination of translation. Proteins
# are unique sequences of amino acids, and most
# codons in messenger RNA correspond to the addition
# of an amino acid to a growing protein chain, stop
#Â codons signal the termination of this process,
# releasing the amino acid chain.
# Here I am removing the stop codon after translation
protein = dna_sequence.translate.chop

# Remove the stop codon after translating
protein = dna_sequence.translate.chop
```

Try to follow the indentation guidelines for the language you're writing in.
Indentation makes code easier to read for you and anyone you share the code
with.

### DRY

DRY means don't repeat yourself. Code for a single function should exist in a
single place. When code needs fixing or maintaining, it only needs to changed
once in the one place that it resides. In the short term it's tempting to copy
and paste to save time, but this will be time consuming in the long term when
debugging.

For example a common function such as system specific BLAST settings, used
across a variety of scripts can be kept in a single file. The can then be
called by any script when required. By moving all the common code to a single
file, if the BLAST settings change, this is done in just one place.

### Books and frameworks

When I used Java, Joshua Bloch's [Effective Java][effective] book helped me
learn a great deal about how to programme well. When learning Ruby I found the
[Ruby Way][way] book had many useful examples of how to write in Ruby. I might
guess for any popular programming language there is a respected book that
illustrates the best practices in the language. These are not the most useful
if you're just starting to learn the language, but as you get more confident
they are great for helping to write better, more maintainable code.

In addition to good books, examples of the best practices in a language can be
found in popular open source libraries. [Rails][rails] is a Ruby framework for
creating dynamic website. Knowing Rails will come in handy if I ever need to
create an interactive website, but practising with Rails also gives an
opinionated view of the best way to organise a Ruby project, from people who
are experienced in creating them.
