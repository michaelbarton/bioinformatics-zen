This is the second post in a series discussing creating simple, reproducible
and organised research workflows. In this post I will describe creating
reproducible workflows using GNU Make to manage the dependencies between
project steps.

A bioinformatics research project should be easily reproducible. Anyone should
be able to repeat all the steps from scratch. Furthermore the simpler it is to
repeat all the project's analyses from the beginning the better.
Reproducibility should also include showing each intermediate step and the
processes used to generate the results. Making a project reproducible makes it
simpler for you to return to a project after several months and repeat your
work. Reproducible research also allows you to share your work with others whom
would like to build upon it.

Build files can be used to manage dependencies between steps in a workflow.
Using a build file in your project therefore goes a long way towards
facilitating reproducible research. [GNU Make][make] provides a syntax to
describe project dependency steps as targets in a computational workflow. Each
target represents a file that should be created from a described set of
commands. An example Makefile looks like this:

[make]: http://www.gnu.org/software/make/

```
two.txt: one.txt
    # Command line steps to create 'two.txt' using 'one.txt'

one.txt:
    # Command line steps to create 'one.txt'
    # Multiple lines of shell commands can be used.
```

Each target is described on the unindented lines. The name of the created file
comes before the colon ':' and the dependencies needed to create this file come
after. The shell commands to used generate the target file are on the indented
lines following the target.

The Makefile example above defines two tasks, each generating a file. In this
example these are the files `one.txt` and `two.txt`. In this workflow the
generation of the file `two.txt` is dependent on the generation of `one.txt`.
Calling `make` at the command line will evaluate the first target at the top of
the file and then evaluate any dependencies required for this target.

The anatomy of a Makefile target is therefore a line containing the name of the
file to create followed by the dependencies required to do this. Shell commands
to generate the target file are then on the subsequent indented lines.
Workflows are created by chaining these targets together: the output file from
one target becomes the dependency for another.

I have started using GNU Make in my computational projects because this syntax
allows for very light-weight specification of a workflow. The dependency system
ensures that each target file is regenerated if any earlier steps change. This
therefore make computational projects very reproducible. I have briefly
described how GNU Make works, and in the sections below I will describe the
advantages of using GNU Make.

## Build workflows independent of any language

When I wrote my original post on ['organised bioinformatics
experiments'][organised] I programmed mainly in Ruby. Therefore using the
Ruby-based Rake as a build tool made sense as I could write in the programming
language I was most familiar with.

[organised]: /post/organised-bioinformatics-experiments/

In the last two years I've been experimenting with other languages such as
Erlang and Clojure. I feel that in future I will continue to try new languages
and include them in my research. Therefore the advantage of using Make over
Rake is that every workflow step is simply a call to the shell rather than
being tied to a specific programming language. This therefore allows me to
write and call scripts written in any language.

In my my current process I package up my analysis code into scripts and call
these from the Makefile. Separating each analysis step into a single file makes
it much easier to switch out one language for another as long as they both
return the same output format. Often I end up replacing scripts with simple
shell-based combinations of pipes and coreutils. Using in-built shell commands
can often be simpler and faster than writing your own script. Finally
separating the analysis targets into individual files further allows an
important aspect for creating more reproducible computational workflows which
I'll outline in the next section. 

## Generative code as a target dependency

Any file can be a dependency to a Make target, including the script doing the
data processing. For example, consider the example Makefile target:

```
output.txt: bin/analyse input.txt
    $^ > $@
```

The target is a file called `output.txt` which requires two dependencies:
`bin/analyse` and `input.txt`. The target code takes advantage of Makefile
macros, which simplify writing targets. In this case `$^` expands to the list
of dependencies and `$@` expands to the target file. This is therefore similar
to writing:

```
output.txt: bin/analyse input.txt
    bin/analyse input.txt > output.txt
```

The advantage of making `bin/analyse` as a target dependency is that whenever
this file is edited this step and any downstream steps will be regenerated when
I call `make` again. This is because `bin/analyse` will have a later time stamp
that than the target file depending on it. This clarifies a critical part of
making workflow reproducible: it is not only when input data changes that a
workflow needs to be rerun, but also any scripts that process or generate data.
Declaring the data processing scripts as dependencies enforces this
requirement.

## Abstraction of analysis steps

Consider this example Makefile with three targets:

```
all: prot001.txt prot0002.txt prot003.txt

%.txt: ./bin/intensive_operation %.fasta
   $^ > $@

%.fasta:
    curl database.example.com/$* > $@
```

Here the target `all` depends on the files: `prot00[1-3].txt`. This target
however defines no code to create them. Furthermore in the following lines
there are no tasks to generate any of these files individually, instead there
are tasks to generate files based on two file type extensions: `.txt` or
`.fasta`. When the Makefile is evaluated these wild card operators are
expanded to create targets for files that match the extensions. For instance
the following steps would be executed to generate `prot001.txt`.

```
prot001.txt: ./bin/intensive_operation prot001.fasta
    ./bin/intensive_operation prot001.fasta > prot001.txt

prot001.fasta:
    curl database.example.com/prot001 > prot001.fasta
```

This wild card % target specification allows the process to be abstracted out
independently of individual files. Generalised targets are instead created for
files based on their file extension. This makes it much simpler to change the
data analysed whilst still maintaining the same workflow. Concretely, this
means you can specify additional files to be generated in the `all` task
without changing the rest of the workflow. Idiomatically, I would use a
variable named `objects` to specify the output I am interested in.

```
objects = prot001.txt prot002.txt prot003.txt

all: $(objects)

%.txt: ./bin/intensive_operation %.fasta
    $^ > $@

%.fasta:
    curl http://database.example.com/$* > $@
```

You could go even further than this however and move the list of target files
to a separate file and read their names in as a dependency. This would mean you
would only change the Makefile when making changes to your workflow, thereby
isolating changes between the workflow process and the workflow inputs to
different files in the revision control history.

## Very simple parallelisation

Bigger data sets require more time to process and taking advantage of
multi-core processors is a cheap way to reduce this. Given the Makefile I
outlined in the previous section I can invoke `make` as follows.

```
make -j 4
```

As I defined my targets above by abstracting out the process based on file
extension each target step can be run independently. Therefore Make can use a
separate process to generate each of the required files. If the number of files
required to be generated exceeds the number of processes specified by the `-j`
flag then these will begin after previous targets have finished. This is a very
cheap method to add multi-core parallelisation to a workflow, as long as you
can abstract out the workflow processes to fit this.

## Summary

GNU Make provides a very elegant functional language, where targets can be
thought of as functions mapping the data from one input file into an output
file. The Make syntax is however still very simple, and adding or updating
tasks is straight-forward. Furthermore it is simple to include your own scripts
as dependencies in a workflow or drop down to fast and powerful combinations of
coreutil functions.
